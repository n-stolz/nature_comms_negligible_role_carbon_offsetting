Kikonda Forest Reserve: The prize winning Kikonda Forestation project lies in the heart of East Africa comprising 120 km² and employing more than 200 people. It is the first in the country to be granted CarbonFix certification for its one-of-a-kind positive social and ecological impact. By 2008 more than 1 million trees had been planted on an area equivalent to approximately 2 000 soccer fields which will store more than 200 000 tonnes of CO2. Through this project, more than 200 people have not only found jobs, but also benefited from additional services provided by the project developer, such as the provision of housing, medical care or the support of local schools. Furthermore, the project has initiated a program to train people of neighbouring villages in tree-planting. The project received in 2006 and 2008 the sought after Ugandan ‘Best Planter Award'. The project has also earned FSC certification.CO2OL Tropical Mix: Degraded land, originally forest land, later used for extensive cattle ranching, is reforested with mostly native tree species and gradually converted into mixed forests. The project provides for sustainable timber production and cocoa cultivation; it protects biodiversity and restores a healthy forest ecosystem. Sustainable forest management and cocoa production offer employment opportunities, therefore improve the economic and social situation of rural communities and families. Moreover, the project helps to promote mutual learning and knowledge transfer. CO2OL Tropical Mix has been one of the first in line to be successfully certified under the renowned Gold Standard for land use and forestry projects; the cocoa production areas have been the first agroforestry systems to be certified under the Gold Standard.Vichada Climate Reforestation Project (PAZ):Located in the Orinoco river basin in Colombia, the Vichada Climate Reforestation projec",106520.00,Compliance with a carbon pricing system,Purchased,Gold Standard

Specifically, the project is of the “Avoided Unplanned Deforestation & Degradation” (AUDD) project category. The project area is located in the collective territories of Bajo Calima and La Plata-Bahía Málaga in the Pacific coastal municipality of Buenaventura, in the Department of Valle de Cauca. Belonging to the biologically diverse Chocó-Darién bioregion, forests in the project area are important nationally and internationally for the ecosystem services they provide. The project area forests, however, have experienced a continued reduction in biomass due largely to illegal logging. These forests have historically been an important source of income for local families, who periodically harvest timber when the economic needs arise.Illegal timber extraction is historically an important source of income within the project zone and is the major focus of the REDD+ project. Following from the gradual degradation of forests caused by continual timber extraction, many forest areas are ultimately converted to agriculture and pasture. The project aims to alleviate these pressures on the forests through the support of governance capacity (including individual property titling, land-use planning and conservation zone demarcation), the generation of alternative economic activities and income sources, and through capacity building in administration and management. These project activities, beyond protecting local forests and biodiversity, contribute to social and economic development in one of the poorest areas of Colombia. The effectiveness of these activities is partially dependent on their long-term economic success and wide-spread adoption.The project objectives are threefold: (i) to mitigate climate change by reducing deforestation and forest degradation, and recuperation of already degraded forest lands; (ii) contribute to biodiversity conservation including High Conservation Values, and (iii) foster sustainable development of local communities.",72412.00,Voluntary offsetting,Purchased,VCS (Verified Carbon Standard)

The project’s Reference Region (RR) is part of the departments of Bolívar and Magdalena, in the Colombian Caribbean, between the Montes de María subregion and the Momposina depression. In the RR, historical, socioeconomic and cultural contexts are associated with the ecosystem richness and productivity, facilitating the establishment and development of agricultural activities by different human populations. The historical development of agricultural and mining activities and the mismanagement of water resources in the region have led to deforestation and forest degradation, making this one of the country’s areas with the greatest loss of natural cover over the years, which has led to forest fragmentation and loss. The Caribbean Region CCMP began its activities on lands that had previously housed fattening cattle, which had the potential to continue growing in number of units, but reforestation and forest conservation activities have prevented the loss of carbon reserves in this privately-owned territory. The Caribbean Region CCMP intends to increase the areas reforested and continue with the activities aimed at preserving existing forest remnants. The Caribbean Region CCMP seeks to become a pioneer project with certified GHG removals and reductions in the Colombian Caribbean since the protection of tropical dry forests and the establishment of native species are aimed at integrating community and environment in a sustainable way.The main objective of the project is to develop activities that promote the positive impacts of sustainable forest production and management on communities and the environment, mitigating the potential negative impacts that forest production can generate both socially and environmentally.
